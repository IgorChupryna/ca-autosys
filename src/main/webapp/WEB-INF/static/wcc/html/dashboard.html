                        <strong>Note:</strong> The selections made in the My Profile dialog affect only the date and time displayed in CA WCC. They do not affect the formatting requirements of fields in CA WCC where you enter date and time. When you enter date and time values in CA WCC, you should use the short format of the selected format locale. Only SAP jobs require a different date and time format.

                <li><p><strong>EEM</strong><br>Opens the CA EEM application, accessible to authorized users only.

            <h2 class="heading2" id="CAWCCDashboard-ApplicationTabs">Application Tabs</h2>
            <p>CA WCC applications are accessed using tabs in the user interface. When you move from one application to another, the displayed information is retained and redisplayed when you return.</p>
