                <p>The chk_auto_up command is a client component that determines whether the event server (database), application server, and the scheduler are running. Because the event server and the scheduler must both be running for a job to start, the chk_auto_up command is the first utility that you should run when troubleshooting why events or jobs are not processing as scheduled.</p>
                <p><strong>UNIX Note:&nbsp;</strong>chk_auto_up uses the product environment variables to locate the configuration file $AUTOUSER/config.$AUTOSERV, and uses the information to determine the application server, data server, and database names. If chk_auto_up completes successfully, the product environment variables and the configuration file are set up correctly.</p>
                <p><strong>Windows Note:</strong>&nbsp;chk_auto_up uses the product environment variables to locate the instance configuration as defined in the CA Workload Automation AE Administrator, and uses the information to determine the application server, data server, and database names. If chk_auto_up completes successfully, the product environment variables and the configuration are set up correctly.</p>
                <p>When you issue the chk_auto_up command, the client (the machine from which you issued chk_auto_up) sends a request to the application server and waits for the application server to respond. The application server performs the following actions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>look for schedulers who report their status as active in the database</li>
                    <li>contact each active scheduler and wait for the schedulers to respond</li>
                    <li>collect all results and prepare a response for chk_auto_up to report</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you are running the instance in High Availability mode with dual event servers, chk_auto_up also reports the state of the system including all schedulers and any occurrence of a database rollover or scheduler failover.</p>
                <p><strong>Syntax</strong></p>
                <p>This command has the following format:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>When CA Workload Automation AE is operating in external security mode and the unauthenticated user mode setting is STRICT, only utilities that successfully authenticate can access objects that are protected by security policy. The following conditions apply:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>When you do not specify one of the external security command line options, the utility attempts to authenticate with cached credentials.</li>
                                            <li>When the utility attempts to authenticate with cached credentials and no credentials are cached, the utility prompts you to specify credentials.</li>
                                            <li>When the utility attempts to authenticate with cached credentials and the credentials are expired, the utility does not run and exits with an error.</li>
                                            <li>When you specify the -usr option and you do not specify the -pw or -pwx option, the utility prompts you to specify a password.</li>
                                            <li>When you specify the -pw or -pwx option but do not specify the -usr option, the utility does not run and exits with an error.</li>
                                        </ul></li>
                                    <li>When CA Workload Automation AE is operating in external security mode and the unauthenticated user mode setting is EXTERNAL, access to objects is governed by security policy but authentication is not handled by the external security server. In this case, the security subsystem assigns security policy identities to all users who validate their identities using the specified external authentication system. If you are not authenticated by the external system, you have no access to objects protected by security policy and may be unable to successfully execute utilities that require access to those objects.</li>
                                    <li>Utilities ignore command line options that specify external security authentication information and cached credentials when any of the following conditions apply:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The unauthenticated user mode setting is EXTERNAL.</li>
