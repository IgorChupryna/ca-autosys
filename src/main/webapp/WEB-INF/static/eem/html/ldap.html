                <p>CA EEM now supports the following LDAP directories configurations:</p>

                        global groups within a specified LDAP directory.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Multiple Microsoft Active Directory Domains</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Specifies that CA EEM resolves the global users and global groups across the configured Active
                    Directory domains or forest. CA EEM supports the following Active Directory configurations:</p>
                <p>Active Directory Domain</p>
                <p>Specifies that CA EEM resolves domain-qualified global users and global groups across the
                    individually configured domains. </p>
                <li><strong>Active Directory Forest</strong><br>Specified that CA EEM resolves domain-qualified global
                    users and global groups across all the domains within the configured forest.
                </li>
                <p>In a multiple Active Directory domain, verify that you do the following tasks:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When authenticating and authorizing a user, use a user principal name in the following

                    </li>
                    <li>When defining access policies, use the principal name of a global user or global group to assign
                        permissions, and use PrincipalName attribute to define filters.
