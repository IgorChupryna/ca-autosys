<h2 class="heading2" id="InstallingonUNIX-(UNIX)InstallCommonComponentsUsingConsoleMode">(UNIX) Install Common
    Components Using Console Mode</h2>
<p>This procedure describes the steps to install the common components on UNIX using console mode. As you proceed
    through the installation, note that pressing the Tab key moves the cursor to a field or an action in a panel.
    Pressing the spacebar selects or clears an option.</p>

<p><strong>Follow these steps:</strong></p>

<ol>
    <li><p>Ensure that the $DISPLAY environment variable is unset.<br>For example, enter the following:</p>
        <div class="code-panel conf-macro output-block" data-hasbody="true"
             data-macro-name="sp-macrooverride-richtextbody-block">
            <pre class="ca-code"><p>unset&nbsp;DISPLAY</p></pre>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>Mount the CA Common Components media.</li>
    <li><p>Run the following command:</p>
        <div class="code-panel conf-macro output-block" data-hasbody="true"

            <pre class="ca-code"><p>./ccc_setup.sh</p></pre>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Note: </strong>The setup script performs various system checks, which takes few minutes.<br>The

    <li>Select the components you want to install by pressing the down-arrow key (or Tab key) to move the cursor through
        the list of components, and using the spacebar to select or clear an item.
    </li>
    <li>Select Next.<br>The next panel appears depending on the components that you selected.</li>
    <li>Continue with the installation by entering the required information on each panel and selecting Next.<br>The
        Review Settings panel appears after the last data entry panel, listing the components that you selected to
        install.
    </li>
    <li><p>Review the information and, if it is correct, select Next.</p>
        <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-note conf-macro output-block" data-hasbody="true"
             data-macro-name="sp-macrooverride-richtextbody-block">
            <strong>Note:</strong> To make a change to an entry, select Back as many times as necessary to locate that
            entry. Then, make the appropriate change, select Next until the Review Settings panel appears, and select
            Next.
        </div>
