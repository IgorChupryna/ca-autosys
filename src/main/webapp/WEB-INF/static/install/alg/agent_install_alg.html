            <p>You can install the agent using the wa_setup.sh script from the CA Workload Automation AE DVD. The agent
                installation must be performed on every computer that you use to run jobs.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>You can install the agent using the CA Workload Automation AE or the CA Workload Automation AE
                        Standalone Agent DVD or by downloading the ISO file by logging in to <em>Download Center,
                            Products</em> in the CA Support Online website (<a rel="nofollow" class="external-link"
                                                                               href="http://support.ca.com">http://support.ca.com</a>).
                    </li>
                    <li>If you have installed the CA Workload Automation AE server or client on this computer, the agent
                        is already installed.
                    </li>
                    <li>We recommend that you use wa_setup.sh to install the agent only if the computer where you want
                        to install the agent is physically accessible. The wa_setup.sh script is large in size and is
                        not as efficient for distributing across the network.
