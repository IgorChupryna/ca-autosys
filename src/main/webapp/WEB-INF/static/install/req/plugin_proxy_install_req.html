            <h2 id="PrepareforInstallation-DecideWhethertoCreateanAlias">Decide Whether to Create an Alias</h2>
            <p>You install an agent plug-in into the agent installation directory to extend the core functionality of
                the agent. By default, the agent plug-in operates under the same agent name that is assigned to the
                agent. An alias lets you create a unique agent name for an agent plug-in, which is useful for
                controlling agent security or for&nbsp;setting up clustered environments. The installation program
                generates the alias by adding a suffix to the agent name.</p>

                <strong>Note:</strong> If you are installing the agent plug-in to work with CA Workload Automation DE,
                an alias is required. Setting up an alias for use with other scheduling managers is optional.
            </div>
            <p>Suppose that you have installed an agent that is named AGT10 on a Windows computer. Users who have access
                to that agent through their security permissions specify AGT10 as the agent name in their job
                definitions. Now suppose that you install an agent plug-in into the installation directory for AGT10.
                You can create an alias for the agent plug-in, for example, AGT10_PROXY. You can then restrict access to
                that alias to only those users that run Remote Execution workload. Those specific users then must
                specify AGT10_PROXY as the agent name in their job definitions.</p>
            <p>Each agent plug-in has a default alias that you can enable during installation. For example, the agent
                plug-in for CA WA Agent for Remote Execution has the default alias&nbsp;<em>agentname</em>_PROXY. You
                can enable or change the default alias name after installation. To work, also configure the alias on the
                scheduling manager.</p>
