            <div><span class="Content"><p>We are currently running DBMaint with archive_events set to 7 days and the database size is growing considerably.</p><p>We would like to verify and monitor the number of rows in the main tables in our AEDB database.</p><p>&nbsp;You can verify the number of rows in the following tables in AEDB database :</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>1. ujo_job:</strong></p><p>The "ujo_job" table stores the definitions common to all job types. The joid (job object ID) column is the unique key for each row. Together, the ujo_job, ujo_sched_info, and the respective job type tables contain all of the job parameters.</p><p>You can run the following query to verify the number of rows in "ujo_job" table :</p><p>select count(*) from ujo_job;</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>2. ujo_sched_info</strong>:</p><p>The "ujo_sched_info" table stores the scheduling information common to jobs of all types.</p><p>You can run the following query to verify the number of rows in "ujo_sched_info" table :</p><p>select count(*) from ujo_sched_info;</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>3. ujo_job_status:</strong></p><p>The "ujo_job_status" table stores the current run information for every job. The joid column is the key field for each row. This table also contains information such as the current status, run number, last start time, last end time, and exit code for each job.</p><p>You can run the following query to verify the number of rows in "ujo_job_status" table :</p><p>select count(*) from ujo_job_status ;</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>4. ujo_job_runs :</strong></p><p>The "ujo_job_runs" table contains a row for each job run. The joid (job object ID), run_num (run number), and ntry (number of tries to run the job) columns are the unique keys for each row. Each row in the table contains a jobâ€™s start time, end time, run time (in seconds), completion status, and exit code. The scheduler updates this table. Together, the ujo_job_run and ujo_extended_job_run tables contain all of the run information for a job. Use the -j parameter with the archive_events command to archive this table.</p><p>You can run the following query to verify the number of rows in "ujo_job_runs" table :</p><p>select count(*) from ujo_job_runs;</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>5. ujo_proc_events :</strong></p><p>The "ujo_proc_event" table stores all processed events.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can run the following query to verify the number of rows in "ujo_proc_event" table :</p><p>select count(*) from ujo_proc_event;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By default, Workload Automation AE keeps 7 days of historical information in AEDB database table.</p><p>You can reduce the volume of the data kept in the database by reducing the number of the days in "DBMaint" file.</p><p>Under Linux and Unix, the "DBMaint" file is located under $AUTOSYS/bin directory.</p><p>Under Windows, you can find the "DBMaint" file under %AUTOSYS%\bin directory.</p></span>
